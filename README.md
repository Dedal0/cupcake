accomodator
===========

accomodaTor is a browser extension that runs Tor flash bridges.

##What the ding dong crap?
There is this thing called a Flash Bridge[1] - basically a code snippet that you run on sites and visitors become tor bridges temporarily.

I kind of love/hate the idea, because visitors aren't willing participants and the bridges last a short short while. But it means that you don't have to run the whole Tor shebang if you only want to make bridges. It's really innovative, and uses technology that >97% of computer owners have.

So, what I want to do is take that same client-side code snippets and turn it into a chrome extension. People install it and they opt-in to become really robust bridges.
